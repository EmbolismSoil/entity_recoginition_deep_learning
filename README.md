# Entity recognition using Deep Learning

Please visit my [medium link](https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/entity-extraction-using-deep-learning-8014acac6bb8) to see the explanation of the project. As explained in the post, the project is based on [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html)â€™s blog about sequence tagging work.
